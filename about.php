        <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
        <p>At Cedar Park Christian School we believe that the basis of all teaching is God and His Word. Our desire is that each student would accept Jesus Christ as his personal Lord and Savior. A goal of our mission is to nurture and train each child so that they will grow in godliness of character and action.</p>
         
        <p>CPCS addresses educational practices from a Christian perspective by offering its students the opportunity to understand themselves and the world around them from a Christian world view. Some of this education will be formal (Chapel, Bible classes and studies, counseling) and some will occur as the faculty and students interact in the normal flow of school activity. The goal is to facilitate the development of the school: spiritually, academically, physically, socially and emotionally. The school employs administration, faculty and staff who serve as role models in their Christian walk, and who are maturing both professionally and in their Christian faith.</p>
         
        <p>In training children to serve the Lord, CPCS makes a strong statement for high academic and social standards of conduct. We believe that the school  is an extension of the home, and we expect parents to support the goals of the school as outlined in the Parental Commitment section of the CPCS Handbook for Parents and Students.</p>
