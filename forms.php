        <h2>PROCUREMENTS AIDS  </h2>
         <p>As the auction chair, I was recently asked what a "procurement" is.  The word "procurement" is Auction-ese for "anything we can auction off".  This can be almost anything that has a value, from a tangible item like a toy, lamp, necklace, roto-tiller or automobile, or an intangible item - a special experience, lessons, or even naming rights to a star.  The list of possibilities is endless.</p>

        <li><a href="docs/2016/2016 Savable Procurement Form & Instructions.pdf">Savable Procurement Form with Instructions</a> For PC's only, not Apple/Mac Computers.  What's an auction without items to sell?  We depend on donations and procurements to help make our auction a success.  This form can be completed, saved to your computer and submitted via email.  This makes it a breeze to locate your donation information at tax time, and it saves you the time and effort of hand-writing and delivering forms.-->    </li>
